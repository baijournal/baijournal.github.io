          MOVEMENTS is a new arts journal published by the Brown Arts Initiative, which brings together multidisciplinary artists to respond to urgent questions in society and culture. We envision this platform as an intersectional praxis tracing pathways between aesthetics, site, and activism. Our contributors are students, academics, journalists and artists connecting theory and embodied creativity - from remix culture to poetic mapping and AI choreography. We are grounded in ethical, compassionate, community-led journalistic and research practices. Our aim is to nurture intellectual and creative integrity and experimentation and engaged cultural criticism.

        What existence has spread all around, discourse organizes. Or better: what the folding has concealed, poetics unfolds. From folding to unfolding, the movement is unceasing
